<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Cement & Glue Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Cement</li><li>Bone Glue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Bone Cement & Glue market encompasses two primary types: bone cement and bone glue. Bone cement is a medical adhesive used to anchor implants during orthopedic surgeries, providing stability and support for bones. It typically consists of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and is crucial for joint replacements. On the other hand, bone glue, often based on biologically compatible materials, serves to bond fractures or surgical sites by promoting healing through its adhesive properties. Both types play vital roles in enhancing surgical outcomes.</p></p>
