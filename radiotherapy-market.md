<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li><li>Internal Beam Radiotherapy Devices</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radiotherapy market is primarily divided into two types: External Beam Radiotherapy (EBRT) devices and Internal Beam Radiotherapy (IBRT) devices. EBRT devices, such as linear accelerators, deliver high-energy radiation from outside the body to target tumors, allowing for precise treatment while sparing surrounding healthy tissues. Conversely, IBRT devices involve placing radioactive sources inside or near the tumor, such as brachytherapy, providing a localized dose of radiation. Both methods are crucial for treating various cancers effectively.</p></p>
